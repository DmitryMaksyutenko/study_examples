PostgreSQL tablespaces allows to control how data stored in the file system.
The tablespaces are very useful in many cases such as managing large tables
and improving database performance.

The tablespace is a location on disk where PostgreSQL stores data files containing
database objects e.g., indexes., and tables. PostgreSQL uses a tablespace to
map a logical name to a physical location on disk.

PostgreSQL comes with two default tablespaces:
 pg_default tablespace stores all user data.
 pg_global tablespace stores all global data.

There are two main advantages of using tablespaces:
  First, if a partition on which the cluster was initialized is out of space, create a new
  tablespace on a different partition and use it until reconfigure the system.

  Second, the statistics of database objectsâ€™ usages to optimize the performance of databases.
  For example, place the frequent access indexes or tables on devices that perform very fast
  e.g., solid state devices, and put the tables containing archive data which is rarely used
  on slower devices.
