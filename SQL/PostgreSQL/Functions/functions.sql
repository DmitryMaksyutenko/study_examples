/*
    Functions written in PL/pgSQL are defined to the server by executing CREATE FUNCTION commands.
    User-defined functions is that they cannot execute transactions.
    In other words, inside a function cannot open a new transaction, even commit or rollback the
    current transaction. Use the procedure insted.


        CREATE FUNCTION somefunc(integer, text) RETURNS integer
        AS 'function body text'
        LANGUAGE plpgsql;

    PL/pgSQL is a block-structured language. The complete text of a function body must be a block.
    A block is defined as:

        [ <<label>>  ]
        [ DECLARE declarations ]
            BEGIN
                statements
            END [ label  ];

    DO statement does not belong to the block. It is used to execute an anonymous block.

    The double dollar ($$) is a substitution of a single quote (â€˜).
    When develop a PL/pgSQL block, a function, or a stored procedure, locate the body in the
    form of a string literal.

    The syntax of declaring a variable:
        variable_name data_type [:= expression];

    To declare a constant in PL/pgSQL, use the following syntax:
        constant_name CONSTANT data_type [:= expression]

    To raise a message, you use the RAISE statement as follows:
        RAISE level format;
            level:
                DEBUG
                LOG
                NOTICE
                INFO
                WARNING
                EXCEPTION
            The format is a string that specifies the message.
            The format uses percentage ( % ) placeholders that will be substituted by the next arguments.

            To raise errors, use the EXCEPTION level after the RAISE statement.
            RAISE statement uses the EXCEPTION level by default.

    The ASSERT statement:
        ASSERT condition [, message];
