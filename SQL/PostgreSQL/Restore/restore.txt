Before restoring a database, terminate all connections to that database and
prepare the backup file. In PostgreSQL, restore a database in two ways:

  Using psql to restore plain SQL script file generated by  pg_dump and pg_dumpall tools.

  Using  pg_restore to restore .tar file and directory format created by the pg_dump tool.
<---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

RESTORE DATABASE USING psql
The psql utility allows to restore SQL script file generated by the pg_dump, pg_dumpall or any
other tools that generates compatible backed up files.
By using the psql tool, execute the entire script.

To restore a full backup and ignore any error occurred during the restoration process,
use the following command:
  sudo -u username psql -U username -f backupfile.sql

If want to stop restoring database in case an error occurs, use the following command:
  sudo -u username psql -U username --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on -f backupfile.sql

If backup specific database objects in a particular database, restore them using the following command:
  sudo -u username psql -U username -d database_name -f objects.sql

RESTORE DATABASES USING pg_restore

SYNOPSIS: pg_restore [connection-option...] [option...] [filename]

The pg_restore program restore databases backed up by the pg_dump or pg_dumpalltools.
The pg_restore program, have various options for restoration databases, for example:
  The pg_restore allows to perform parallel restores using the -j option to specify the number
  of threads for restoration. Each thread restores a separate table simultaneously, which speeds
  up the process dramatically. Currently, the pg_restore support this option for the only custom
  file format.

  The pg_restore enables to restore specific database objects in a backup file that contains
  the full database.

  The pg_restore can take a database backed up in the older version and restore it in the
  newer version.
