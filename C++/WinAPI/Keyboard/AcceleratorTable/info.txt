An ACCELERATOR table is a data resource that maps keyboard combinations to applicatin commands. 

A RESOURSE is a data blob that is build into an application binary.
    Resources store data that are needed by the application, 
    such as menus, cursors, icons, images, text strings, or any custom application data.
    The application loads the resource data from the binary at run time. 
    To include resources in a binary, do the following:

    1. Create a resource definition (.rc) file. This file defines the types of resources and their identifiers. 
        The resource definition file may include references to other files. For example, an icon resource is 
        declared in the .rc file, but the icon image is stored in a separate file.
    2.Use the Microsoft Windows Resource Compiler (RC) to compile the resource definition file into 
        a compiled resource (.res) file. The RC compiler is provided with Visual Studio and also the Windows SDK.
    3. Link the compiled resource file to the binary file.
