Race condition: 
    A race condition is a situation, in which the result of an operation depends on the 
interleaving of certain individual operations

Data race: 
    A data race is a situation, in which at least two threads access a shared variable at the same time. 
At least on thread tries to modify the variable

A memory barrier:
    Also known as a membar, memory fence or fence instruction, is a type of barrier instruction 
that causes a central processing unit or compiler to enforce an ordering constraint on memory operations issued 
before and after the barrier instruction. This typically means that operations issued prior to the barrier are 
guaranteed to be performed before operations issued after the barrier.

Deadlock:
    In concurrent computing, a deadlock is a state in which each member of a group is waiting for another member, 
including itself, to take action, such as sending a message or more commonly releasing a lock. 
Deadlock is a common problem in multiprocessing systems, parallel computing, and distributed systems, 
where software and hardware locks are used to arbitrate shared resources and implement process synchronization
