There are two distinct types of socket network applications: Server and Client.

Servers and Clients have different behaviors; therefore, the process of creating them is different.
What follows is the general model for creating a streaming TCP/IP Server and Client.

Server
1   Initialize Winsock.
2   Create a socket.
3   Bind the socket.
4   Listen on the socket for a client.
5   Accept a connection from a client.
6   Receive and send data.
6   Disconnect.

Client
1   Initialize Winsock.
2   Create a socket.
3   Connect to the server.
4   Send and receive data.
5   Disconnect.
