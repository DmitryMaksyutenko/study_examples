# Each regular expression in a urlpatterns is compiled the first time itâ€™s
# accessed. This makes the system blazingly fast.

# re_path(route, view, kwargs=None, name=None) - Returns an element for
# inclusion in urlpatterns.
# route - is a string or gettext_lazy() that contains regular expression.
# view, kwargs, name - the same as for path().

# In Python regular expressions, the syntax for named regular expression groups
# is (?P<name>pattern), where name is the name of the group and pattern is some
# pattern to match.
